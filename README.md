## What is it useful for?
- It is useful for those who want to draw shapes with some colors and textures on canvas.

- The main purpose of this program is to visualization a huge amount of shapes that don't overlap with each other on canvas. If some of your data have overlap with each other then maybe you get in trouble with your view after zoom in/out or moving over shapes.
